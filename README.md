# Screens Workflow

It is a set of basic and generic screens that form a small reusable skeleton for any game to be developed on the Unreal Engine.

The available screens are the following:

- Main menu
- Options
- Credits
- Level selection
- Gameplay / HUD
- Level completed
- Player died

In addition, it includes two loading screens:
- Loading game
- Loading level

The main difference is that "Game Loading" appears, as the name suggests, when the game is starting or in loading processes that do not refer to a game level.

The "Loading level" screen is intended to display information about the level being lodaded.

All screens have a very basic and minimalist design so that they can be adapted to any project.
